## Last Week's Accomplishments

In these past two weeks, I have gotten Jaqualyn Iradella to send out our anonymous accessibility features survey to those students identifying with having a physical disability that would require them to use our app. Thus far, we have received two responses (better than none!). These students would like to see zoom and assistive touch in our UI, and have also commented on the general poor functioning of the manual automatic door push buttons. 

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan to follow up with the usability testing group that reached out to my group to schedule usability testing input. They reached out a few weeks ago (2-ish), I wrote back, and I haven't heard anything yet. Thus, I will be sending a followup email to them to try and get them out here for testing. 

## Anything Blocking?

No real blockers for me at the moment, just need to get a hold of the usability folK!
