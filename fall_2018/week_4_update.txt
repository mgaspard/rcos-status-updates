## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we did not receive any additional input on the Accessibility Survey, nor did we hear back from the Usability Testing Group. I sent them a followup email, so hopefully they will respond to us soon, as we are nearing the stage of usability testing. 

## This Week's Plan

This week / beginning of next, I hope to get with Prof. Turner to learn how to push the data / better document the survey responses so that this information can be used in the future should others take over the project in the future. 

## Anything Blocking?

No real blockers for me at the moment, other than trying to get in touch with Usability. 

## Notes

None
