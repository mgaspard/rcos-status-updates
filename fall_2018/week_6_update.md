## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week and the start of this week, I met with Prof. Turner and came up with a plan for testing. I wrote a well-crafted letter addressed to Facilities Management seeking permission to test on the Amos Eaton side door which is equipped with traditional automatic door controls. The letter was sent to Fixx, and on 11/6, Fixx forwarded it to their director for review. 

## This Week's Plan

This week, I will await the Facilities Director's response regarding our installation and testing plan. Upon receiving their response, I will continue with negotiations and making a testing plan with the proper personnel, and consult Prof. Goldschmidt and Prof. Turner as well. 

## Anything Blocking?

None, just waiting on FIXX!
