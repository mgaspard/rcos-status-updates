## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week was Thanksgiving break, thus not a lot was accomplished on the advocacy front during that time. However, most of our work has been done yesterday and today. Yesterday, I confirmed the ADC testing with Dave Ira and Paul, the leaders of facilities management at RPI. Today, we tested ADC for the first time in Amos Eaton Hall, and it worked on the first attempt. We also made modification to the Arduino code that matches the functionality of the traditional buttons so that the door doesn't have to be closed manually, it'll automatically close after 7-10 seconds. 

## This Week's Plan

This week, I will be discussing patents as well as how we are going to publish the app as a group on the App Store. I will be meeting with the proper personnel so that we move forward in the right direction. 

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers, just trying to get a good clear plan for the future!
