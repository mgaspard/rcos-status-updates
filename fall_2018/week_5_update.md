## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I continued to contact the HCI Group to inquire about usability testing. However, I am still unsuccessful in getting in touch with them. 

## This Week's Plan

This week, we are coming up with a plan for prototype testing! I believe we are aiming to test either this Sunday or next Sunday. We will be searching for doors, preferably the Amos Eaton automatic door to test our product, and we need to get the necessary permissions to do so. 

## Anything Blocking?
