## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I finalized a google form survey that addresses potential UI features that would assist users with app accessibility. I emailed the google form survey to the Head of Disability Services, Jaqualyn Iradella, for her to forward the survey to potential users on RPI's Campus.


## This Week's Plan

This week, I will monitor survey input and relay the information back to the team in order to gauge which accessibility features we should incorporate in our UI. Jack and I are also hoping to schedule a meeting with Disability Services to demo our app. 

## Anything Blocking?

No real blockers for me at the moment, only at the mercy of how quickly people fill out the survey!
