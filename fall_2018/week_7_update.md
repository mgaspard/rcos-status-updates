## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, we received confirmation from RPI Facilities to complete testing of our device on the Amos Eaton automatic door provided that the Access Control Technician, Paul Mason, is present. We also should not disrupt the door's current functionality and we should not alter the structure of the building. I have also emailed Paul Mason to schedule a time and date for testing. 

## This Week's Plan

This week, I hope to hear back from Paul Mason regarding an official testing date and time. Once I gather his availability, I will coordinate with my team to determine the time when all of us can be present with Paul for testing, so that all of us can see the product in action and determine what improvements we can make. 

## Anything Blocking?

None, just waiting on Paul!
