## Last Week's Accomplishments

In the past few weeks, we assembled our team for this semester and began working toward our goal of a working prototype. 

On the advocacy end, I developed a survey for the Disability Services Office to send to students regarding what accessibility features they'd like to see in an app, as well as which locations on campus they would like to see accessibility improved.


## This Week's Plan

This week, I will hopefully hear back from Jaqualyn in the Disability Services office regarding our survey. If she is unable to send it to those students, we will go back to the drawing board and see if we could possibly pitch this on the class facebook page or something. 

## Anything Blocking?

No real blockers for me at the moment!
